# CS 111 - Operating Systems

This repository contains all project work for CS 111 at UCLA (Fall 2018, Peter Reiher). Note that as a Masters student, I did not have to submit these projects for grading and was doing them to the best of my ability as I had time. Because of this, certain projects are missing and/or incomplete.

## Missing Projects

* Project 3A - File System Interpretation
* Project 3B - File System Consistency Analysis
* Project 4C - Internet of Things Security

## Incomplete Projects

Each project has its own README. Please refer to the individual README's for a list of known issues and/or incomplete aspects.
