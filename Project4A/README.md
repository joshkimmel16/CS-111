# CS 111 - Project 4A - Beaglebone Bring-Up

A description of the project can be found in **P4A.html**.

## Deviations from the Project Description

* For primarily financial reasons, I decided to use a RaspberryPi 3 instead of a Beaglebone.
* I decided not to go through the process of taking the required screenshots. Committing them would be of no particular use from a coding standpoint.
